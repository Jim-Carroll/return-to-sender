# Return to Sender

I hate waste.

We can control how much we waste as individuals, but we have little control over how wasteful others are.

Return to Sender is a service that provides an easy way to stop unwanted mail. The interface is simple: send in a picture of both the sender and recipient, and that's it (well, for now). The sender will be sent a request to stop sending mail to the recipient in the best, most professional way possible.

Literally tons of energy and resources are wasted every day because of unwanted mail. Whether the mail is for a service the recipient is not interested in, or it is sent to the wrong recipient all together, it will usually go directly into the trash (or recycling, if we're lucky). The purpose of this service is to make is a simple as possible for *you* to tell companies and people you do *not* want their mail, thus putting an end to the tremendous amount of waste that is the result of old-fashioned advertising methods.

Now, some unwanted mail is not just advertisements and marketing. If you've ever moved into a new apartment, you know the frustration of constantly receiving someone else's mail (usually a previous tenant). R2S exists to address that issue, too. If the 'sender' parameter is omitted from the R2S submission, then a request to stop all mail sent to the recipient-address combination will be made.

Ideally, this application will be short-lived. Companies will develop better ways to advertise. We will come up with a better way to make address changes. But for now, its purpose is to tackle the issue head-on, and stop the enormous amount of waste happening right now.
